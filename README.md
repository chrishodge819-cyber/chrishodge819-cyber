# Hi, I'm Chris Hodge  
### Applied Philosopher • Systems Thinker • Founder of Symmetry Earth Labs

Welcome to the conceptual and developmental home of the **Proportional Stability Algorithm (PSA)** — a framework I’m building to help bridge human meaning, natural structure, and future intelligence systems.

I’m not a traditional engineer or computer scientist.  
I’m a thinker, a writer, and a builder of ideas from the ground up.  
My work here is about **mapping structure**, **understanding proportion**, and developing the foundational concepts behind PSA and the Law of Hausation.

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

### **🧠 Proportional Stability Algorithm (PSA)**  
A conceptual framework describing how systems maintain balance, adapt, and create through proportional interaction.

### **📘 Law of Hausation**  
A formal statement of nature’s principle of proportional stability — applied from micro-level structures to large-scale systems.

### **🌐 Proportionally Stable AI**  
Laying the groundwork for an AI model that does *not* imitate human emotion, but understands the **structure** of human emotion and behaves with stability, ethics, and clarity.

### **📜 PSA: Language of Creation**  
A universal conceptual language connecting action, structure, feedback, and creation — the philosophical backbone of PSA.

### **🏛️ PSA Company Constitution**  
The guiding principles and moral architecture for **Symmetry Earth Labs**, the organization built to demonstrate PSA in real-world systems.

## 🌍 Why I'm Doing This  
I’ve spent my life thinking deeply about systems, meaning, proportion, and human experience.  
Only recently did I realize — through writing — that these thoughts form a coherent framework worth building, documenting, and sharing.

I’m not trying to be someone I’m not.  
I’m simply putting my ideas into the world in an honest way, one piece at a time.

This GitHub is where those ideas live, grow, and take shape.

## ✍️ Writing & Collaboration  
I also write professionally — concept pieces, spiritual reflections, systems explanations, and specialty content.

If you're interested in collaborating, you can find me on:

- **Upwork** (freelance writing & concept development)

Thanks for stopping by — and for taking the time to explore the early foundations of PSA and Symmetry Earth Labs.
